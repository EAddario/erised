# erised
A simple **http server** to test arbitrary REST API responses.

# Usage
`erised [options]`
```text
Parameters:
  -idle int
    	maximum time in seconds to wait for the next request when keep-alive is enabled (default 120)
  -json
    	use JSON log format
  -level string
    	one of debug/warn/error/off (default "info")
  -port int
    	port to listen (default 8080)
  -read int
    	maximum duration in seconds for reading the entire request (default 5)
  -write int
    	maximum duration in seconds before timing out response writes (default 10)
```

For help type **erised -h**

Upon executing **erised** with no parameters it will listen on port **8080** for incoming http requests.

The latest version is available as a Docker image at [edaddario/erised](https://hub.docker.com/r/edaddario/erised)

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 edaddario/erised
```

HTTP methods (e.g. GET, POST, PATCH, etc.), query strings and body are **ignored**. URL Paths are also ignored, except for:

|Name|Purpose|
|--|--|
|erised/headers|Returns request headers|
|erised/info|Returns miscellaneous information|
|erised/ip|Returns the client IP|
|erised/shutdown|Shutdowns the server|

Response behaviour is controlled via custom headers in the http request:

|Name|Purpose|
|--|--|
|X-Erised-Content-Type|Sets the response _Content-Type_. Valid values are **text** (default) for _text/plain_, **json** for _application/json_, **xml** for _application/xml_ and **gzip** for _application/octet-stream_. When using **gzip**, _Content-Encoding_ is also set to **gzip** and the response body is compressed accordingly.|
|X-Erised-Data|Returns the **same** value in the response body|
|X-Erised-Headers|Returns the value(s) in the response header. Values **must** be in a JSON key/value list|
|X-Erised-Location|Sets the response _Location_ to the new (redirected) URL or path, when 300 â‰¤ _X-Erised-Status-Code_ < 310|
|X-Erised-Response-Delay|Number of **milliseconds** to wait before sending response back to client|
|X-Erised-Status-Code|Sets the HTTP Status Code|

By design, no validation is performed on _X-Erised-Data_ or _X-Erised-Location_.

Valid _X-Erised-Status-Code_ values are:
```text
OK or 200 (default)

MultipleChoices or 300
MovedPermanently or 301
Found or 302
SeeOther or 303
UseProxy or 305
TemporaryRedirect or 307
PermanentRedirect or 308

BadRequest or 400
Unauthorized or 401
PaymentRequired or 402
Forbidden or 403
NotFound or 404
MethodNotAllowed or 405
RequestTimeout or 408
Conflict or 409
Gone or 410
Teapot or 418
TooManyRequests or 429

InternalServerError or 500
NotImplemented or 501
BadGateway or 502
ServiceUnavailable or 503
GatewayTimeout or 504
HTTPVersionNotSupported or 505
InsufficientStorage or 507
LoopDetected or 508
NotExtended or 510
NetworkAuthenticationRequired or 511
```
Any other value will resolve to 200 (OK)

# Known Issues
**erised** is full of bugs and "_...men have wasted away before it, not knowing if what they have seen is real, or even possible..._" so use it with caution for it gives no knowledge or truth.

Of all of its deficiencies, the most notable is:
* https protocol is not yet supported

I may or may not address this in a future release. Caveat Emptor

# Motivation
When developing and testing REST based API clients, sooner or later I'd come across situations where I needed a quick and easy way to dynamically test endpoint's responses under different scenarios. Although there are many excellent frameworks and mock servers available, the time and effort required to configure them is sometimes not justified, specially if the application under test provides 10's or 100's of paths, so after some brief and unsuccessful googling I decided to create my own.

**erised** was inspired somewhat by [Kenneth Reitz's](https://kennethreitz.org/) HTTP Request & Response Service [httpbin.io](https://httpbin.org/) and it may offer similar functionality in future releases.

The typical use case is to get a response to an arbitrary http request where the content of the body has a predetermined value and your ability to control the server's behaviour is limited or non-existent.

Imagine you're developing some client for [api.chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/) and want to test the **/jokes/random** path. You could certainly make live calls against the server:
```sh
curl -w '\n' -v -k https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random
```
(response edited for clarity)
```sh
*   Trying 104.31.94.71...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to api.chucknorris.io (104.31.94.71) port 443 (#0)
> GET /jokes/random HTTP/2
> Host: api.chucknorris.io
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/2 200
< date: Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:21:14 GMT

* Closing connection 0
```

**Or**, better yet, you could use **erised** like this:
```sh
curl -w '\n' -v \
-H "X-Erised-Status-Code:OK" \
-H "X-Erised-Content-Type:json" \
-H "X-Erised-Data:{\"categories\":[],\"created_at\":\"2020-01-05 13:42:26.766831\",\"icon_url\":\"https://assets.chucknorris.host/img/avatar/chuck-norris.png\",\"id\":\"CfW0ccNFTpeq_v1r13IjTQ\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-01-05 13:42:26.766831\",\"url\":\"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/CfW0ccNFTpeq_v1r13IjTQ\",\"value\":\"The lord giveth and Chuck Norris taketh away\"}" \
http://localhost:8080/jokes/random
```
```sh
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /jokes/random HTTP/1.1

-H "X-Erised-Status-Code:NotFound" \
-H "X-Erised-Content-Type:json" \
-H "X-Erised-Data:{\"timestamp\":\"2020-12-30T11:21:32.793Z\",\"status\":404,\"error\":\"Not Found\",\"message\":\"Chuck Norris knows everything there is to know - Except where this page is.\",\"path\":\"/jokes/random\"}" \
